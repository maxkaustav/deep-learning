# Deep-learning
All deep learning models are available here.
The models are all trained on a Nvidia quadro P5000 gpu with 16 GB of VRAM.
So please try to use this model on same infrastructure for same inference.

# Deep Learning The State of Art
State of ar model has brought an incredible change in Technology .<br>
From BERT to GAN all of the models are best in its own way.We try to implement all the models in a jupyter notebooks becaus it is more intuitive to use and to understand.<br>
We will be upgrading this repository with more state of art models.

# We are accepting Contributions
We accept models compiled on a jupyter notebook.<br>
The system information should be mentioned with a snapshot<br>
Test file should be created to a particular input.We will be contating for more information if needed.<br>
